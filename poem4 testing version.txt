andere versiin; after John Donne’s ‘A Nocturnal on St Lucy’s Day’

At lunchtime on the year’s midnight
into my mind came
I saw the new moon late yestreen
wi the auld moon in her airms
though, no,
there is no moon of course –
there’s nothing very much of anything to speak of
in the sky except a gey dreich greyness
rain-laden over Glasgow and today
there is the very least of even this for us to get
but
the sun comes back
the sun always comes back
and this begins tomorrow with
however many hours more of sun and light.

there will be the winter for us to love the longest,
quiet in the frosty sky among the biggest stars,
and lines of old songs we can’t remember
why we know
or when first we heard them
will aye come back
once in a blue moon to us
unbidden and amazing

and bless us with their long-travelled light.
